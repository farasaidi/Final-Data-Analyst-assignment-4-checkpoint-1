Data Analysis Final Project Checkpoint One
Dataset: Rental Bike Sharing 
Business Issue
I'd like to explore the dataset to see how much people are interested in bike sharing systems, when they are on demand and how it helps people's daily life.


*Note: this project contains information from the Capital bike share database which shares data from 2011 till 2016.
